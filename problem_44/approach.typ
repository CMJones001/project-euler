Find the sum of pentagonal numbers $P_j$ and $P_k$ such that both their sum and differenc is also pentagonal. Find the value for which D = | P_k - P_j| is minmised.

= Problem 44 - Pentagonal Numbers

We are interested in the pentagonal numbers, $P$,

$ P_n = n/2 (3n-1) = 1/2 (3n^2 - n) $

we are interested in the case where both the sum and difference of two pentagonal numbers are also pentagonal.

== Useful relations

$ P_(n+1) = 1/2 (3 n^2 + 5 n + 2)$

=== Sums

We trivially get that the sum of two pentagonal numbers, $P_n$ and $P_m$ are given by

$ 1/2 (3m^2 - m + 3n^2 - n) $

so for the case $m = n$

$ 2P_n = 3n^2 - n $

with sum of the next terms $m = n+1$,

$ 3 n^2 + 2 n + 1 $

or $m = n+2$

$ 3 n^2 + 5 n + 5 $

=== Differences

The differnce between two adjacent terms, $P_(n+1) - P_n$, is given by 
$ P_(n+1) - P_n = 3 n + 1 $

this means that
